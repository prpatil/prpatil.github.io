Welcome to my website. I'm Prasad Patil. I look more or less like this:

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Boston University School of Public Health.
I completed my post-doc at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Department of Data Sciences with <a href="http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~gp/">Giovanni Parimigiani</a>.<br>
I completed my PhD in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with <a href="http://jtleek.com/">Jeff Leek</a>.<br>
I'm interested in personalized medicine, genomics, prediction, data visualization, and study reproducibility/replicability.
You can <b>email</b> me at <b>prpatil42 || gmail || com</b> (fill those bars in with the usual).<br> 
I'm currently thinking about:
<ul>
<li> Multi-study prediction </li>
<li> Statistical definitions for reproducibility and replicability.</li>
<li> Stable and interpretable prediction methods for gene expression data. The contexts are cancer risk classifcation and survival prediction.</li>
<li> Assessing the additional value a genomic signature can provide beyond standard clinical measurements in a randomized trial setting.</li>
<li> Interactive health visualizations executable in one line from R.</li>
<li> Automated analysis templates with the ability to compare results after parameters have been changed.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for coming. Now that I have my own domain, I *may* improve site aesthetics, if only to prove that I know how to use computers.
